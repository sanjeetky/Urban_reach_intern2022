        <ul>
          <li>
            Farmers experience price risk, information asymmetry about demand,
            distribution inefficiency, and receive late payments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Retailers face problems like higher costs, low quality and
            unhygienic produce, high price volatility, and the everyday hassle
            of going to the market.
          </li>
          <li>
            The traditional Supply Chain is highly inefficient, unorganized, and
            has a high rate of food wastage.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3 style={{color: "green",fontWeight: 'bold',textAlign: 'left'}}> Our Solution</h3>
      <div class="card-body" style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We eliminate intermediaries by taking control of the Supply Chain by
            using technology and analytics.
          </li>
          <li>
            We build reliable, cost-effective, and high-speed logistics and
            infrastructure to solve for inefficiencies in the Supply Chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            On one end, farmers get better prices and consistent demand, and on
            the other end, retailers receive fresh produce at competitive prices
            that are delivered to their doorstep.
